## Potential Topics
The organizers will propose a list of topics that need exploration and practical work.
This list will be distributed among the participants, as well as basic system requirements to conduct the hands-on coding.
The organizers will also solicit additional topics from the participants.
Additional topics may arise during the seminar and will be dynamically included.
As a result, the seminar will provide a validation or falsification of the explored ideas, as well as specifications and implementations where possible.
All implementations will be open source and made publicly available via GitHub.

The topics of interest for this GI-Dagstuhl Hackathon include but are not limited to

- application of ICN concepts to IoT.
- extending, enhancing, unifying existing ICN codebases for well-known IoT operating systems such as RIOT.
- exploring data-centric security in IoT, trying out various security methods, evaluating feasibility, etc.
- other non-ICN topics for IoT.


## Submission guidelines

Submit the following details in a single PDF file to the [organizers](mailto:aa@cs.ucla.edu,oleg@riot-os.org,m.waehlisch@fu-berlin.de)
 * brief CV.
 * brief motivation statement.
 * topics that you are interested in.
 * link to your code repository (e.g., GitHub), if available.
 * indication if you plan to attend IETF 99 as well.

Feel free to already sketch a concrete project that you want to work on.

Note that all code contributions of the GI-Dagstuhl Hackathon will be open source and made publicly available via GitHub.

If you never visited Schloss Dagstuhl before, we encourage you to have a brief look into the [venue description](venue).

We hope that the hackathon will be a fun event for all and that projects will lead to collaborations extending beyond the Hackathon.

In case of any questions, do not hesitate to contact the [organizers](mailto:aa@cs.ucla.edu,oleg@riot-os.org,m.waehlisch@fu-berlin.de).
