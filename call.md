## Submission guidelines

Submit the following details in a single PDF file to the [organizers](mailto:aa@cs.ucla.edu,oleg@riot-os.org,m.waehlisch@fu-berlin.de)
 * brief CV.
 * brief motivation statement.
 * topics that you are interested in.
 * link to your code repository (e.g., GitHub), if available.
 * indication if you plan to attend IETF 99 as well.

Feel free to already sketch a concrete project that you want to work on.

Note that all code contributions of the GI-Dagstuhl Hackathon will be open source and made publicly available via GitHub.

If you never visited Schloss Dagstuhl before, we encourage you to have a brief look into the [venue description](venue).

We hope that the hackathon will be a fun event for all and that projects will lead to collaborations extending beyond the Hackathon.

In case of any questions, do not hesitate to contact the [organizers](mailto:aa@cs.ucla.edu,oleg@riot-os.org,m.waehlisch@fu-berlin.de).
