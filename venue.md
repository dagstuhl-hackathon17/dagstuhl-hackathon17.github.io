## About Schloss Dagstuhl

The GI-Dagstuhl IoT Hackathon will take place at Schloss Dagstuhl.
Schloss Dagstuhl was founded in 1990 and quickly became established as one of the world's premier meeting centers for informatics research.

## Why a hackathon at Dagstuhl?

The hackathon will tackle very challenging research questions.
In the past, the research community learned that solid solutions for challenging problems require real-world experiences, in particular in the context of wireless and embedded systems.
To be successful on a short time scale, a tight feedback loop of conceptual and implementation work needs a noiseless environment, allowing the participants to interact immediately face to face, in smaller and larger groups.
The facilities of Dagstuhl provide exactly this.
Furthermore, the atmosphere of Dagstuhl will allow junior researchers to easily get in contact with senior scientists.

## Accommodation and Costs

Participants of the hackathon will stay at Schloss Dagstuhl.
Each participant need to pay 50 EUR per night for accommodation and full board.
There is no registration fee required.

## Getting to Schloss Dagstuhl

If you have never attended a Dagstuhl event, we highly recommend to read the directions very carefully.
In particular, the last mile might be difficult to conquer.
